Who - A simple VCGen for higher-order programs.

To install the program, do:

autoconf
./configure
make
(sudo) make install


The binary will be installed in the default binary directory, and it is called

  who-vcg

Common usage is:

  who-vcg <file.who>

This will generate a file <file_who.pge>, for further treatment with
pangoline. 

Currently, pangoline needs the option --desectionize when given files
generated with who-vcg.
