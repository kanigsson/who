IMPORTANT FEATURES

polymorphic arguments
subtyping
initial label for beginning of function

MINOR ISSUES

PROOFS

Hashtbl

COQ

INTERNAL
* infix at variable place instead of application
* remove annotparser
* type annotations at let
* use positions in parser better
* use printTree for MutableType


BUGS

* check types for well-formedness
* binding!!!!

DONE:
* False
* proof obligations disappear
* simple stuff not proved?? (false alarm)
* separate pretty printers
* output several coq files (as pangoline)
* OR: pangoline Coq output
simplification of tuples directly in [get_tuple]
read/write
inductive declarations
* void/ unit type
* instantiation for polymorphic constants
* int_max, int_min
* remove stuff about singleton regions
