IMPORTANT FEATURES
allow non-values at top-level

MINOR ISSUES
error messages for unknown variables in internalize

PROOFS

Hashtbl

COQ

* Sections need a dot
* void/ unit type

INTERNAL

* only inline effect polymorphic definitions

* separate simplifications for effect records:
  - inlining of effect polymorphic lets
  - modelisation of effect vars by regions
  - elimination of regions

* "inference" for partial effect instantiations:
  example: eff_var2.who

* do not allow effect variables in abstract type definitions
  put types in variables

* pretty printing



BUGS

* sequences ';' still not fixed
* find bug with "nil" - postponed
* check types for well-formedness
* syntax for type-only abstraction and instantiation should ressemble ocaml a
  bit more

* binding!!!!
