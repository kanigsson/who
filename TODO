BUGS

* check types for well-formedness
* binding!!!!

DONE:
* False
* proof obligations disappear
* simple stuff not proved?? (false alarm)
* separate pretty printers
* output several coq files (as pangoline)
* OR: pangoline Coq output
simplification of tuples directly in [get_tuple]
read/write
inductive declarations
* void/ unit type
* instantiation for polymorphic constants
* int_max, int_min
