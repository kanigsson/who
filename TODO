PROOFS

Hashtbl

COQ

* Sections need a dot
* void/ unit type

INTERNAL

* only inline effect polymorphic definitions

* separate simplifications for effect records:
  - inlining of effect polymorphic lets
  - modelisation of effect vars by regions
  - elimination of regions

* "inference" for n-ary applications in ast.ml
* additional Type variables for [region] and [refty]
* "inference" for partial effect instantiations:
  example: eff_var2.who

BUGS

* sequences ';' still not fixed
* find bug with "nil" - postponed
* check types for well-formedness
