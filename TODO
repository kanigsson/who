IMPORTANT FEATURES

inductive declarations
polymorphic arguments
read/write
remove stuff about singleton regions
subtyping
initial label for beginning of function

MINOR ISSUES

simplification of tuples directly in [get_tuple]

PROOFS

Hashtbl

COQ

* void/ unit type
* instantiation for polymorphic constants
* int_max, int_min

INTERNAL

* separate pretty printers

BUGS

* check types for well-formedness

* binding!!!!

DONE:
* False
* proof obligations disappear
* simple stuff not proved?? (false alarm)
