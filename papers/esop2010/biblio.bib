  abstract = {\emph{Defunctionalization} is a program transformation
                 that eliminates functions as first-class values. We
                 show that defunctionalization can be viewed as a
                 \emph{type-preserving} transformation of an extension
                 of \f with \emph{guarded algebraic data types} into
                 itself. We also suggest that defunctionalization is an
                 instance of \emph{concretization}, a more general
                 technique that allows eliminating constructs other than
                 functions. We illustrate this point by presenting two
                 new type-preserving transformations that can be viewed
                 as instances of concretization. One eliminates
                 Rémy-style polymorphic records; the other eliminates
                 the dictionary records introduced by the standard
                 compilation scheme for Haskell's type classes.}

data structure with good performance. Their genericity permits developing
a wealth of structures like ordered sequences or interval trees

used by current functional languages do not guarantee the coherent
parameterization and specialization of Finger Trees, let alone the
correctness of their implementation.
We present a certified implementation of Finger Trees solving
these problems using the {P}rogram extension of {C}oq. 
We not only implement the structure but also prove its
invariants along the way, which permit building certified
structures on top of Finger Trees in an elegant way.},

  functional features within the general framework of type theory.
  
  Type theory constitutes a powerful specification language, which is
  naturally suited for the proof of purely functional programs. To
  deal with imperative programs, we propose a logical interpretation
  of an annotated program as a partial proof of its specification. The
  construction of the corresponding partial proof term is based on a
  static analysis of the effects of the program, and on the use of
  monads. The usual notion of monads is refined in order to account
  for the notion of effect. The missing subterms in the partial proof
  term are seen as proof obligations, whose actual proofs are left to
  the user. We show that the validity of those proof obligations
  implies the total correctness of the program.
  We also establish a result of partial completeness.
  
  This work has been implemented in the Coq proof assistant.
  It appears as a tactic taking an annotated program as argument and
  generating a set of proof obligations. Several nontrivial
  algorithms have been certified using this tactic.}
